            <h2>Why Should I ski In the Alps?</h2>

            <h3>BECAUSE ITS AMAZING!!! </h3>
            There are many places a person can travel to for what will feel like a once in a lifetime ski trip. The Alps are not much more expensive or difficult to get to, from the US East Coast, than ski resorts in Rocky Mountains.  Lift tickets are a lot less expensive for resorts in France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and Germany than they are for ski destinations in the United States.  Height, the alps are higher with a lot more above the treeline skiing which delivers the top of the world, above it all feeling.  While delicious food can be found most places where one can ski, amazing food is standard in Europe, one need not be in a city to find world class cuisine.  A wonderful plate of pasta or charcutire or fondue is almost universal.  Culture, while there is absolutely nothing wrong with what the US or Canada has to offer, it is amazing to see and learn about other cultures which is what you see when traveling abroad.

            <h3>BE PREPARED!!!</h3>
            Insurance and know your limits.  Make sure to follow safety adviseries, the temptation to find fresh powder off of the marked trails maybe strong but it can also be deadly.  Follow recommendations for guides and take suggested safety gear.  Safety equipment such as a shovel, a pack, an avalanche probe, and emergency beacon are easy to rent.  Most lift tickets offer some form of safety insurance, most hotels are also knowledgable about how to arrange it.  The saftey insurance for mountain evacation is typically very inexpensive but the cost of a helicopter ride or other transport of the mountain is incredibly expensive.
